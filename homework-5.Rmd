## Elastic Net Tuning

For this assignment, we will be working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

Read in the file and familiarize yourself with the variables using `pokemon_codebook.txt`.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(yardstick)
library(corrr)
library(pROC)
library(ISLR) # For the Smarket data set
library(ISLR2) # For the Bikeshare data set
library(discrim)
library(poissonreg)

```

```{r}
Pokemon <- read_csv("/Users/michellesack/Desktop/UCSB/Senior yr/Spring/PSTAT 131/homework-5/data/Pokemon.csv")
head(Pokemon)
```

### Exercise 1

Install and load the `janitor` package. Use its `clean_names()` function on the Pokémon data, and save the results to work with for the rest of the assignment. 

```{r}
#install.packages('janitor')
library(janitor)
```

```{r}
Pokemon_cleaned <- clean_names(Pokemon)
Pokemon_cleaned
```
What happened to the data? Why do you think `clean_names()` is useful?

The column names in the resulting data frame no longer contain any capitalization or period marks. This will make it easier to work with and analyze this data frame. 

### Exercise 2

Using the entire data set, create a bar chart of the outcome variable, `type_1`.

```{r}
require(openintro)
require(lattice)
barchart(Pokemon_cleaned$type_1)
```

How many classes of the outcome are there? Are there any Pokémon types with very few Pokémon? If so, which ones?

There are 18 classes of the outcome variable. The class with very few Pokemon is the "Flying" class.

For this assignment, we'll handle the rarer classes by simply filtering them out. Filter the entire data set to contain only Pokémon whose `type_1` is Bug, Fire, Grass, Normal, Water, or Psychic.

```{r}
Pokemon_filtered <- filter(Pokemon_cleaned, type_1 %in% c("Bug", "Fire", "Grass", "Normal", "Water", "Psychic"))
Pokemon_filtered
```

After filtering, convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors.

```{r}
Pokemon_filtered$type_1 <- as.factor(Pokemon_filtered$type_1)
Pokemon_filtered$legendary <- as.factor(Pokemon_filtered$legendary)
```

### Exercise 3

Perform an initial split of the data. Stratify by the outcome variable. You can choose a proportion to use. Verify that your training and test sets have the desired number of observations.

```{r}
set.seed(1999)
pokemon_split <- initial_split(Pokemon_filtered, prop = 0.80,
                                strata = type_1)
pokemon_train <- training(pokemon_split)
pokemon_test <- testing(pokemon_split)
nrow(pokemon_train)
nrow(pokemon_test)
```

Next, use *v*-fold cross-validation on the training set. Use 5 folds. Stratify the folds by `type_1` as well. *Hint: Look for a `strata` argument.* Why might stratifying the folds be useful?

```{r}
pokemon_folds <- vfold_cv(pokemon_train, v = 5, strata = type_1)
```

Stratifying the folds might be useful in providing more trustworthy and accurate results when testing the model against the data, since it will focus on the outcome variable.  

### Exercise 4

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`.

```{r}
pokemon_recipe <- recipe(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense + hp + sp_def, data = pokemon_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_novel(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_center(all_predictors())
```
  
- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;

- Center and scale all predictors.

### Exercise 5

We'll be fitting and tuning an elastic net, tuning `penalty` and `mixture` (use `multinom_reg` with the `glmnet` engine).

Set up this model and workflow. Create a regular grid for `penalty` and `mixture` with 10 levels each; `mixture` should range from 0 to 1. For this assignment, we'll let `penalty` range from -5 to 5 (it's log-scaled).

```{r}
multinom_reg_pokemon <- multinom_reg(mixture = tune(), penalty = tune()) %>% 
  set_engine("glmnet") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")

# set up the workflow and fit the model to the training data
multinom_wkflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(multinom_reg_pokemon) %>% 
  add_recipe(pokemon_recipe)

pokemon_grid <- grid_regular(penalty(range = c(-5, 5)), mixture(range = c(0,1)), levels = 10)
pokemon_grid
```

How many total models will you be fitting when you fit these models to your folded data?

There will be 500 models. This is because there are 100 models and 5 folds.

### Exercise 6

Fit the models to your folded data using `tune_grid()`.

```{r}
tune_res <- tune_grid(
  multinom_wkflow,
  resamples = pokemon_folds, 
  grid = pokemon_grid)
```

Use `autoplot()` on the results.

```{r}
autoplot(tune_res)
```

What do you notice? Do larger or smaller values of `penalty` and `mixture` produce better accuracy and ROC AUC?

The graph shows that smaller values of both penalty and mixture produce better accuracy and ROC AUC.

### Exercise 7

Use `select_best()` to choose the model that has the optimal `roc_auc`. Then use `finalize_workflow()`, `fit()`, and `augment()` to fit the model to the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

```{r}
best_model <- select_best(tune_res)
final_workflow <- finalize_workflow(multinom_wkflow, best_model)
final_fit <- fit(final_workflow, data = pokemon_train)
augment(final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>% accuracy(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class)
```

### Exercise 8

Calculate the overall ROC AUC on the testing set.

Then create plots of the different ROC curves, one per level of the outcome. Also make a heat map of the confusion matrix.

What do you notice? How did your model do? Which Pokemon types is the model best at predicting, and which is it worst at? Do you have any ideas why this might be?

```{r}
augment(final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test, type = 'prob') 
ROC_curve <- augment(final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>%
  roc_curve(type_1, estimate = c(.pred_Bug,.pred_Fire,.pred_Grass,.pred_Normal,.pred_Psychic,.pred_Water)) %>%
  autoplot()
ROC_curve
```

```{r}
confusion_matrix <- augment(final_fit, new_data = pokemon_test) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class) %>%
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")
confusion_matrix
```

From the results, we can see that our model is better for predicting Normal, and Psychic than it is the other 4 classes. The reason the other 4 classes, Bug, fire, water, and grass, might be harder to predict could be because of a large amount of similarities between these classes, which would make it difficult for the model to decipher between them.
